# DripShippa: Decentralized Shipping Brokerage on Polygon zkEVM

**DripShippa** is a next-generation shipping brokerage platform that leverages blockchain, AI, and modern web technologies to create a secure, transparent, and automated maritime logistics marketplace. The platform is deployed on the Polygon zkEVM Cardona testnet and is built using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), and Google Gemini-powered AI agents (integrated via Supabase Edge Functions).

## 🚢 What is DripShippa?

DripShippa connects shippers and carriers in a decentralized marketplace, enabling:

- **NFT-based Orders:** Every shipping order, vessel, cargo, and journey is represented as a unique NFT on-chain.
- **Parametric Insurance:** Smart contracts provide customizable, automated insurance policies for shipments, with instant payouts based on real-world data triggers.
- **AI-Powered Routing & Risk:** Google Gemini agents (invoked via Supabase Edge Functions) suggest optimal shipping routes and assess risk for insurance, making logistics smarter and safer.
- **Transparent Brokerage:** All order matching, insurance, and journey logs are recorded on the Polygon zkEVM blockchain for full transparency.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 1. Blockchain-Powered Shipping

- **VesselNFT, CargoNFT, JourneyNFT, InsurancePolicyNFT, Brokerage** contracts deployed on Polygon zkEVM.
- All shipping assets and transactions are tokenized and verifiable on-chain.

### 2. Parametric Insurance

- Create or select insurance policies (delay, weather, piracy, etc.) with automated, data-driven payouts.
- Policies are enforced by smart contracts and can be customized via the UI.

### 3. AI-Driven Logistics

- **Route Optimization:** Google Gemini agents (via Supabase Edge Functions) suggest optimal shipping routes and visualize them on interactive maps.
- **Risk Assessment:** AI agents analyze routes and conditions to recommend insurance coverage and premiums.

### 4. Supabase Integration

- Real-time database for orders, policies, and user profiles.
- Edge Functions for AI agent integration (Gemini) and secure backend logic.
- Auth and RLS for secure, user-specific data access.

### 5. Lovable Development

## 🧠 AI Agents: Google Gemini (via Supabase Edge Functions)

- **Route Planning:** The `AiRouteModal` component invokes a Supabase Edge Function (`gemini-maps-handler`) that uses Google Gemini to suggest and visualize optimal shipping routes.
- **Risk Analysis:** The `ContractBuilder` page uses an AI agent (`ai-risk-assessor`), also powered by Supabase Edge Functions, to analyze risk and recommend insurance parameters.
- **Supabase Edge Functions** serve as the secure integration layer between the app and Google Gemini, ensuring privacy and scalability.

## 📦 Smart Contracts

- **VesselNFT:** Tokenizes vessels.
- **CargoNFT:** Tokenizes cargo.
- **JourneyNFT:** Tracks journeys.
- **InsurancePolicyNFT:** Manages insurance policies.
- **Brokerage:** Handles order matching and settlement.

All contracts are deployed on Polygon zkEVM Cardona testnet.
